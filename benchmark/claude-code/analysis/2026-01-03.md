## Analysis

### What Changed

PR #102 softens the gabb_structure guidance in the MCP server instructions. Previously, the guidance was aggressive:

> **BEFORE using Read on ANY supported code file, you MUST call `gabb_structure` FIRST.**

The fix removes the mandatory requirement, making it a recommendation for larger files rather than a strict rule.

### Observed Behavior

1. **gabb_structure usage dropped to zero**: The softened guidance eliminated pre-read structure checks entirely for this task. Claude determined the files were small enough to read directly.

2. **Read calls decreased 14%**: Fewer file reads overall, suggesting Claude is being more efficient without the mandatory pre-check overhead.

3. **Grep calls increased 28%**: Claude compensated by using more targeted searches instead of reading file structures first.

4. **No performance regression**: Time, tokens, and cost remained essentially flat (all within noise).

### Conclusion

The fix achieves its goal:
- Removes unnecessary overhead for simple tasks
- Maintains 100% success rate
- No measurable performance regression
- Claude appropriately skips gabb_structure when not needed

**Recommendation**: Ready to merge.
