## Transcript Analysis

### Best Case: astropy\_\_astropy-14995 (-66.4%)

**Control behavior** (38-72s): Heavy exploration
- 7-14 Bash calls, 4-7 Grep, 2-7 Read
- Lots of trial-and-error searching

**Gabb behavior** (15-18s): Focused and efficient
- Just 2-3 Grep + 0-1 Read
- Direct path to solution

**Why Gabb helped:** The MCP context helped Claude focus exploration instead of wandering.

### Second Best: astropy\_\_astropy-7746 (-60.4%)

**Control behavior** (111-177s): Extensive exploration
- 19-28 Bash calls, 11-16 Read
- Very exploratory approach

**Gabb behavior** (22-95s): More direct
- Best runs: just 2 Read calls
- Even worst run (95s) still faster than control average

**Why Gabb helped:** Reduced need for extensive Bash exploration.

### Regression: django\_\_django-11620 (+268.7%)

**Control behavior** (13-26s): Direct and efficient
- Just 1-2 Read calls
- Knew exactly where to look

**Gabb behavior** (51-72s): Over-exploration
- 6-14 Bash, 6-9 Grep, 7-8 Read
- Task agent spawned unnecessarily

**Why Gabb hurt:** Simple task where control was already optimal. MCP guidance may have encouraged unnecessary exploration.

## Recommendations

1. **Overall positive:** 13.8% time improvement justifies the 8.3% token cost for most use cases.

2. **Investigate over-exploration:** The `django__django-11620` regression suggests the MCP skill guidance may encourage exploration on tasks that don't need it. Consider:
   - Adding guidance to skip `gabb_structure` for small/simple changes
   - Reducing "exploration encouragement" language in skill file

3. **gabb_structure underutilized:** Only 0.1 calls/run in Gabb condition. The wins came from general MCP context, not the structure tool specifically. Consider:
   - Making `gabb_structure` guidance more prominent
   - Or accept that the skill file context alone provides value

4. **Next steps:**
   - A/B test modified skill guidance that discourages exploration on simple tasks
   - Run focused test on regression task to confirm hypothesis
