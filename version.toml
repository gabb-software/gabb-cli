# Semantic version components managed manually
# Patch number is automatically set to the GitHub Actions run number
#
# To bump versions:
#   - major: Breaking changes or major milestones
#   - minor: New features or significant improvements
#
# The full version becomes: {major}.{minor}.{run_number}
# Example: 0.9.142 (where 142 is the CI build number)

major = 0
minor = 9
